# Music_player
It will fetch all .mp3 files from your mobile internal storage..

when u install this app for the 1st time this app will get crashed.
dont worry.

you have to give permission to access your internal storage manually.
go to..
setting->apps->music-player(name of an app)->permissions->select storage

afteru can open music player.

enjoy......
